How I Used GitHub Copilot

I used Copilot to help generate the initial structure for my CategoryChart React component and to help scaffold chart-related props. Example prompts I used:

"Generate a React Native pie chart component using react-native-chart-kit"

"Create a helper function to format chart data from an array of category totals"

Copilot also assisted in quickly producing repetitive JSX patterns and prop structures.

Suggestion I Rejected

Copilot suggested hard-coded category colors and sample dummy data for the PieChart.
I rejected this because the project requirement specifies that the chart must use real app data, not static placeholder data.

Example Where Copilot Saved Me Time

Copilot saved significant time by auto-generating the repetitive chartData.map() formatting and providing the correct props for the chart library. This reduced the time needed to look up documentation and allowed me to focus on debugging the data flow from my SQLite queries.
